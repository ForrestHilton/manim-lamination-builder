methods to add:
minor: I need to know the minor of an FDL.




refactoring ideas:
AbstractLamination -> _AgnosticLamination
AngleSet instead of polygon the idea is to insist that its in ascending order


Maybe points should be imbued with a label that we can interpret at render time instead of a visual_setting property.
The lamination shouldn't need to know if there is a dark theme.

Should I make laminations into a tree structure by default so that I can quickly check for crossings? It would seam that I would need to establish what are now the components of the structure as its observers.
